# vacsine - Adaptive continuous security orchestration in polymorphous environments

Ensure security of systems based on policies, continuous monitoring, and assessing security (certification) requirements in Cloud-Edge/Fog-IoT network environments.

The VaCSInE tool provides adaptative continuous security orchestration in edge/fog and cloud infrastructures. It relies on Service Function Chaining (SFC) and continuous monitoring to provide dynamic reconfiguration of the infrastructure.

Use cases
-------

* Enforce security policy on the edge infrastructure based on certification criteria
* Continuous self-assessment for adaptative security with service function chaining
